# Microservices with Node JS, React, Docker and Kubernetes
This project aims to set up the mini microservice with **Node JS, React, Docker and Kubernetes**.

## Microservices
Microservice architecture, or simply microservices, is a distintive method of developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function modiels with well-defined interfaces and operatrions. The trend has grown popular in recent years as Enterprises look to become more Agile and move towards a DevOps and continuous testing.

**[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualisation to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.

## Kubernetes

**[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)**(K8s) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling and management. It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling and operations of application containers across cluster of hosts. It works with a range of container tools, including Docker. Many cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based platform or infrastructure as a service (PaaS or laaS) on which Kubernetes can be deployed as a platform-providing service. Many vendors also provide their own branded Kuberneted distributions.
